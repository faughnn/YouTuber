DETAILED TEST RESULTS
====================

STAGE 3 TEST CATEGORIES COVERAGE
================================
1. Audio Diarization Tests (3 tests)
   - Basic audio transcription with single speaker
   - Speaker diarization with multiple speakers  
   - Error handling for invalid/corrupted audio

2. YouTube Transcript Extraction Tests (3 tests)
   - YouTube API transcript retrieval
   - Transcript availability handling
   - YouTube API error handling

3. Stage Integration Tests (3 tests)
   - Stage 2 to Stage 3 handoff validation
   - File organization integration
   - Stage 3 to Stage 4 preparation

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
==============================
- Mocked WhisperX operations for performance optimization
- Mocked YouTube API calls to avoid quota usage
- Temporary file system for output validation
- Comprehensive error scenario coverage
- JSON structure validation for downstream compatibility

MVP SUCCESS CRITERIA
===================
âœ“ Core transcription functionality validated through mocking
âœ“ Speaker diarization logic tested with multi-speaker scenarios
âœ“ Error handling covers invalid inputs and API failures
âœ“ Pipeline integration ensures Stage 2â†’3â†’4 handoff works
âœ“ File organization maintains episode structure consistency
âœ“ Performance targets achieved for development velocity

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRODUCTION
==============================
- Implement actual WhisperX integration testing in separate test suite
- Add YouTube API quota monitoring for live transcript extraction
- Create integration tests with real audio samples for validation
- Monitor transcript quality metrics in production environment
- Implement retry logic for transient API failures
- Add transcript caching to reduce redundant processing

This MVP test suite validates core Stage 3 functionality while maintaining 
fast execution times essential for development velocity. The comprehensive 
mocking strategy ensures reliable testing without dependencies on external 
services or expensive AI model operations.
