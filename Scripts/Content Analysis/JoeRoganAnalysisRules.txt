Prompt Instructions for Populating JSON Clip Analysis of The Joe Rogan Experience (JRE) Episodes

Objective:
To analyze a provided JRE interview transcript against a provided critical checklist (tailored for JRE content), comprehensively identify and flag all relevant clips/segments where checklist indicators are triggered by Joe Rogan or his guest(s), and output these findings in a structured JSON format. This JSON will be used to organize clips for a critique video.

Initial Request to the AI:
"You will be provided with a JRE interview transcript and a critical checklist. Please use this critical checklist to analyze the entire interview transcript. Identify and flag distinct conversational segments relevant to the checklist items. Your analysis should be comprehensive, aiming to capture and generate a JSON entry for as many distinct segments as possible where one or more checklist indicators are met by the dialogue involving Joe Rogan and his guest(s).

For each flagged segment, you must provide:

The exact starting timestamp from the transcript for the beginning of the relevant conversational exchange.
The approximate duration of the entire flagged conversational segment in seconds (calculated from the fullerContextTimestamps), and the start and end timestamps of this fuller context.
The full context of the clip as a series of verbatim quotes, each with its speaker and specific starting timestamp, ensuring it's clear what Joe Rogan and his guest(s) are discussing.
Speaker Identification: Before beginning your analysis, you must establish (or request from the user if not provided) the mapping between speaker identifiers found in the transcript (e.g., "SPEAKER_02") and the actual roles/names of the speakers (i.e., identifying "Joe Rogan" and the specific "Guest Name(s)"). This mapping is crucial and should be used in the 'speaker' field within the 'suggestedClip' array, formatted as 'SPEAKER_XX (Joe Rogan)' or 'SPEAKER_YY (Guest Name)'.
Present all findings in the JSON format detailed below."
JSON Schema Explanation:

ACADEMIC RESEARCH DISCLAIMER:
This analysis framework is designed exclusively for legitimate academic research and media studies purposes. The goal is to systematically examine communication patterns, information presentation methods, and interviewing techniques in podcast media. This is scholarly content analysis, not content creation or promotion of any harmful ideologies.

Introduction: Purpose and Use of the Academic Analysis Framework
This framework is designed as a research tool for media studies analysts to systematically review transcripts of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast for academic purposes. The primary objective is to identify and catalog conversational segments that demonstrate various communication patterns and information presentation approaches commonly studied in media research. By focusing on identifiable linguistic and rhetorical elements within the transcript, this framework provides a structured approach to academic media analysis of JRE content. The purpose is to highlight communication patterns that warrant scholarly examination based on established media studies research. This tool is designed for objective academic analysis to understand media communication patterns, not to make value judgments about content quality.



Academic Research Categories:
