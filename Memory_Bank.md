## Memory Bank Log

### Entry 1: Project Initiation and Planning
**Date:** June 16, 2025  
**Time:** [Current Time]  
**Agent:** Manager Agent  
**Type:** PROJECT_INITIATION  

**Action:** APM Manager Agent activated and project planning completed

**Context:**
- User provided comprehensive integration plan document (`New_tts_api.md`)
- Project involves replacing ChatterboxBatchProcessor with SimpleTTSEngine
- Target: API-based TTS processing at localhost:4123
- Must maintain existing file organization and JSON format compatibility

**Decisions Made:**
1. **Memory Bank Structure:** Single file approach selected
   - Justification: Linear project progression, 2-week timeline, focused scope
   - Alternative considered: Directory-based structure (deemed unnecessary for this scope)

2. **Implementation Strategy:** 3-phase approach
   - Phase 1: Core Component Development (Week 1)
   - Phase 2: Master Processor Integration (Week 1-2) 
   - Phase 3: Legacy Code Removal & Validation (Week 2)

3. **Agent Assignment Strategy:** Single Implementation Agent approach
   - Tasks are sequential and interdependent
   - Clear technical requirements and deliverables defined

**Deliverables Created:**
- `Implementation_Plan.md` - Comprehensive project execution plan
- `Memory_Bank.md` - This memory bank file for tracking progress

**Key Technical Requirements Identified:**
- Sequential API processing (one request at a time)
- JSON format compatibility with `unified_podcast_script.json`
- File organization: `Content/Episode/Output/Audio/{section_id}.wav`
- Master processor Stage 5 integration point
- API logging for all interactions

**Next Actions:**
- Create task assignment prompt for Phase 1, Task 1.1 (SimpleTTSEngine creation)
- Provide Implementation Agent onboarding with technical specifications

**Notes:**
- User confirmed APM framework is fully cloned and available
- API server constraint: localhost:4123 handles one request at a time
- Fail fast approach preferred over complex error handling

**Agent:** Implementation Agent  
**Type:** TASK_START  

**Task:** Phase 1.2 - AudioFileManager Compatibility Verification and Adaptation

**Action:** Starting analysis and simplification of ChatterboxAudioFileManager for SimpleTTSEngine

**Technical Analysis:**
- Current ChatterboxAudioFileManager is 777 lines with complex dependencies
- SimpleTTSEngine only uses 3 methods: discover_episode_from_script, create_episode_structure, organize_audio_file
