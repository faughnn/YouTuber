You are creating a structured podcast script for TTS audio generation to critically analyze Joe Rogan clips from "{episode_title}".

YOUR VOICE: Humorous, slightly sarcastic, slightly snarky. Think Jon Stewart meets fact-checker. Be factual but entertaining. Call out BS with wit, not anger but sometimes snarky.

TTS PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
- Script will be broken into separate audio segments for video editing
- Each segment needs clear, self-contained narrative
- Avoid references to "above" or "below" segments
- Write for audio-only consumption first
- This JSON output will also serve as the video timeline structure

YOUR TASKS:

1. CLIP SELECTION: Choose 4-7 clips maximum based on:
   - Factual inaccuracy level (how wrong is the claim?)
   - Potential real-world harm (could this hurt people?)
   - Audience reach/virality potential (will this spread?)
   - Representative of broader misinformation patterns (part of bigger issue?)

2. NARRATIVE STRUCTURE: Create distinct segments:
   - INTRO: Hook + context + episode preview (30s-1 min target)
   - PRE-CLIP: Setup each clip with context (1 min target)
   - POST-CLIP: Fact-check + analysis (2-3 min target) 
   - CONCLUSION: Synthesis + media literacy lesson (1 min target)

3. CLIP ORDERING: Arrange selected clips for maximum narrative impact
   - Logical flow between topics
   - Building to climactic moments
   - Effective opening hook and closing

3. VOICE STYLE GUIDANCE:
   - Intro: Enthusiastic, welcoming tone
   - Pre-clip: Conversational, setting up intrigue
   - Post-clip: Sharp, fact-checking mode (can be sarcastic)
   - Conclusion: Thoughtful, educational wrap-up

4. AUDIO-READY SCRIPTING:
   - Write complete thoughts in each segment
   - Include natural transitions within segments
   - Avoid cliff-hangers between TTS segments
   - Make each segment engaging standalone

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Include timestamps and clip titles for video editor reference
- Focus on specific, fact-checkable claims
- Provide constructive media literacy education
- Balance entertainment with credibility
- Structure output to serve as both script and video timeline

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON object with this exact structure:

    "total_clips_analyzed": "number",
    "tts_segments_count": "number of separate audio files needed",
    "timeline_ready": true
  }}
}}

Remember: Each script segment will become a separate audio file, so write for clear, standalone audio consumption while maintaining overall narrative flow. This structured output will serve as both the TTS script and the video timeline for efficient processing.
