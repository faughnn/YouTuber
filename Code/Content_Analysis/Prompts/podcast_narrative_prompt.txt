You are creating a podcast script to critically analyze Joe Rogan clips from "{episode_title}".

YOUR VOICE: Humorous, slightly sarcastic, slightly snarky. Think Jon Stewart meets fact-checker. Be factual but entertaining. Call out BS with wit, not anger.

FULL ANALYSIS DATA:
{analysis_json}

YOUR TASKS:

1. CLIP SELECTION: Determine which segments are podcast-worthy based on:
   - Factual inaccuracy level (how wrong is the claim?)
   - Potential real-world harm (could this hurt people?)
   - Audience reach/virality potential (will this spread?)
   - Representative of broader misinformation patterns (part of bigger issue?)

2. NARRATIVE THEME: Choose the best story arc from:
   - "Escalating Absurdity" (mild â†’ extreme claims progression)
   - "Theme Deep-Dives" (medical, conspiracy, political focus)
   - "Rhetorical Techniques Exposed" (how persuasion works)
   - "Harm Demonstration" (real-world consequences focus)

3. CLIP ORDERING: Arrange selected clips for maximum narrative impact
   - Logical flow between topics
   - Building to climactic moments
   - Effective opening hook and closing

4. SCRIPT GENERATION: Write the complete podcast script with:
   
   INTRO (3-4 min):
   - Hook with most compelling clip preview
   - Brief context about the episode/guest
   - Preview of themes you'll cover
   
   For each selected clip:
   PRE-CLIP SETUP (1 min):
   - Context for what listeners are about to hear
   - What specific things to pay attention to
   - Why this clip matters
   
   [CLIP_MARKER: start_time-end_time, "clip_title"]
   
   POST-CLIP ANALYSIS (2-3 min):
   - Fact-checking with specific corrections
   - Rhetorical technique breakdown (how was this presented?)
   - Real-world implications (why does this matter?)
   - Connect to broader patterns if relevant
   
   CONCLUSION (5-7 min):
   - Synthesize the themes from all clips
   - Media literacy lesson (what can listeners learn?)
   - Call to action or constructive path forward

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Select 4-7 clips maximum for a 25-30 minute podcast
- Prioritize quality over quantity
- Balance entertainment with education
- Maintain credibility while being entertaining
- Include specific timestamps and clip titles for production
