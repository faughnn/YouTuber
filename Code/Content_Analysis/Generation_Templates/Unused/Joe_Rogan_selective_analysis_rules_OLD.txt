SELECTIVE HIGH-IMPACT ANALYSIS RULES
=====================================

Level 1: CRITICAL Severity

Content: The segment contains direct, actionable advice or information that poses an immediate and severe risk to health or safety.
Examples:
Promoting unproven or dangerous treatments for serious diseases.
Giving specific, unqualified medical advice (e.g., "You should take X dosage of Y to cure Z").
Explicitly promoting baseless anti-vaccine theories as fact.


Level 2: HIGH Severity

Content: The segment contains explicit misinformation on major topics, presented as fact.
Examples:
Presenting a well-known conspiracy theory as a certainty.
Outright dismissal of established scientific consensus on major issues.


Level 3: MEDIUM Severity

Content: The segment contains more subtle forms of misinformation, oversimplification, or the authoritative presentation of unverified claims.
Examples:
Presenting a highly biased or unsubstantiated opinion on a complex topic as an authoritative, factual analysis.
Using anecdotes, misleading statistics, or manipulative framing to undermine trust in public institutions, science, or specific communities.
Gross oversimplification of complex geopolitical, economic, or social issues in a way that promotes a harmful or false narrative.


PRIORITIZATION ORDER (Select only the worst examples in this order):
1. Direct medical advice without disclaimers
2. Conspiracy theories presented as fact
3. Anti-vaccine or anti-science misinformation
4. Promotion of dangerous treatments
5. Authoritative claims about complex topics without expertise
