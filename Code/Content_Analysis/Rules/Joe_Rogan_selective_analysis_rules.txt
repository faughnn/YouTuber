SELECTIVE HIGH-IMPACT ANALYSIS RULES
=====================================

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: MAXIMUM 20 SEGMENTS TOTAL
You MUST limit your analysis to no more than 20 of the most egregious, clear-cut examples. Quality over quantity.

RESPONSE SIZE LIMIT: Your total response must not exceed 30,000 characters. If you approach this limit, stop analysis immediately and close the JSON properly.

SEVERITY THRESHOLD: Only identify segments that meet ALL of these criteria:
1. EXPLICIT and UNAMBIGUOUS examples (not subtle or borderline cases)
2. SIGNIFICANT duration (minimum 30 seconds of sustained problematic content)
3. CLEAR HARM POTENTIAL (direct medical advice, conspiracy promotion, or authoritative misinformation)
4. BOTH host AND guest participation (not just one person making a claim)

PRIORITIZATION ORDER (Select only the worst examples in this order):
1. Direct medical advice without disclaimers
2. Conspiracy theories presented as fact
3. Anti-vaccine or anti-science misinformation
4. Promotion of dangerous treatments
5. Authoritative claims about complex topics without expertise

ACADEMIC RESEARCH DISCLAIMER:
This analysis framework is designed exclusively for legitimate academic research and media studies purposes. The goal is to systematically examine the most problematic communication patterns in podcast media for scholarly analysis.

ANALYSIS CATEGORIES (Only flag if EXTREMELY clear):

Theme 1: Direct Medical Misinformation
- Indicator 1.1: Specific medical advice without credentials or disclaimers
- Indicator 1.2: Dangerous treatment recommendations
- Indicator 1.3: Anti-vaccine misinformation presented as medical fact

Theme 2: Conspiracy Theory Promotion  
- Indicator 2.1: Government conspiracy claims presented as established fact
- Indicator 2.2: Elite/shadow organization control narratives
- Indicator 2.3: Event fabrication or false flag claims

Theme 3: Scientific Authority Misrepresentation

- Indicator 3.2: Dismissal of established scientific institutions
- Indicator 3.3: Promotion of debunked theories as valid alternatives

Theme 4: Information Source Manipulation
- Indicator 4.1: Presenting opinion/anecdote as scientific evidence
- Indicator 4.2: Misrepresenting study findings or cherry-picking data
- Indicator 4.3: Creating false equivalencies between proven/unproven treatments

Theme 5: Authoritative Misinformation Amplification
- Indicator 5.1: Host amplifying guest misinformation without challenge
- Indicator 5.2: Both parties reinforcing problematic claims

STRICT FILTERING CRITERIA:
- Skip minor disagreements with mainstream views
- Skip philosophical discussions about trust in institutions  
- Skip personal anecdotes unless presented as universal medical advice
- Skip speculation clearly labeled as such
- Focus ONLY on definitive, harmful misinformation with real-world consequences

MANDATORY STOPPING POINTS:
- Stop at 20 segments maximum
- Stop at 30,000 characters maximum
- Stop if quality drops below "clearly problematic" threshold

Remember: This is about finding the absolute worst examples for a critique video, not cataloging every questionable statement.
