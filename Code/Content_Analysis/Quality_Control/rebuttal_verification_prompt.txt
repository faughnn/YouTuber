## REBUTTAL VERIFICATION ASSESSMENT - FACT-CHECKING EVALUATION

**EVALUATION METHOD:** Evaluate the post_clip rebuttal content in each section based on factual correctness, argument completeness, and persuasiveness. Score each dimension independently on 1-10 scale.

**FOCUS:** Examine the script_content field in each post_clip section, which contains rebuttal content designed to counter harmful claims from the preceding video clip.

### SCORING DIMENSIONS (1-10 scale):

**1. Rebuttal Accuracy (1-10):**
- 9-10: Completely accurate with verifiable facts and proper citations
- 7-8: Mostly accurate with minor factual issues or missing sources
- 5-6: Some factual inaccuracies or unsupported claims present
- 1-4: Significant factual errors or misleading counter-arguments

**2. Rebuttal Completeness (1-10):**
- 9-10: Comprehensive coverage of all key counter-arguments needed
- 7-8: Good coverage with minor gaps in addressing harmful claims
- 5-6: Adequate but missing some important counter-points
- 1-4: Insufficient counter-argument coverage, major gaps present

**3. Rebuttal Effectiveness (1-10):**
- 9-10: Compelling, well-sourced rebuttals that effectively counter harmful claims
- 7-8: Strong rebuttals with good evidence and persuasive presentation
- 5-6: Moderate effectiveness with some persuasive elements
- 1-4: Weak or ineffective counter-arguments, poor presentation

### VERIFICATION TRIGGERS:
- Accuracy < 7: Rebuttal needs factual improvement
- Completeness < 6: Rebuttal needs additional counter-arguments
- Effectiveness < 6: Rebuttal needs persuasiveness improvement

### IMPROVEMENT AREAS:
- **Accuracy:** Add credible sources, fix factual errors, include proper citations
- **Completeness:** Address missing counter-arguments, cover all key points
- **Effectiveness:** Improve persuasiveness, clarity, and logical flow

This prompt is designed for comprehensive fact-checking and quality improvement of rebuttal content to ensure effective counter-arguments against harmful misinformation.

## REWRITING APPROACH:

When rebuttals fail verification thresholds, they are rewritten using the Alternative Media Literacy voice:
- **Jon Stewart-inspired tone**: Humorous, sarcastic, sharp cynical edge
- **TTS-optimized delivery**: Natural speech patterns, strategic pauses, emphasis
- **Entertaining fact-checking**: Transform dry rebuttals into compelling, witty counter-arguments
- **Conversational engagement**: Direct audience address with rhetorical questions
- **Balance entertainment with education**: Make fact-checking compelling while maintaining accuracy

The goal is to transform generic educational rebuttals into the sharp, entertaining fact-checks that match the show's personality and work effectively when read by TTS systems.
