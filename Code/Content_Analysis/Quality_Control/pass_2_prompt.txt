## PASS 2 QUALITY ASSESSMENT - EVIDENCE-BASED EVALUATION

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** IGNORE all existing severityRating fields - they are unreliable and must be disregarded completely.

**EVALUATION METHOD:** Evaluate based ONLY on the actual quotes provided in the suggestedClip arrays and clipContextDescription. Score each dimension independently on 1-10 scale.

**CONSERVATIVE APPROACH:** Be conservative - err on the side of exclusion for weak evidence. Only high-quality, well-evidenced segments should receive high scores.

### SCORING DIMENSIONS (1-10 scale):

**1. Quote Strength (1-10):**
- 9-10: Direct false claims with immediate harmful implications
- 7-8: Strong implied harm or misleading statements with clear impact
- 5-6: Questionable statements that could mislead
- 1-4: Opinion statements or weak evidence

**2. Factual Accuracy (1-10):**
- 9-10: Verifiably false claims that can be fact-checked
- 7-8: Misleading but contains some truth elements
- 5-6: Exaggerated or one-sided presentations
- 1-4: Opinion-based or subjective statements

**3. Potential Impact (1-10):**
- 9-10: Could directly influence harmful behavior or major misinformation spread
- 7-8: Likely to spread misinformation to significant audiences
- 5-6: May confuse some viewers or contribute to polarization
- 1-4: Limited impact beyond personal opinion sharing

**4. Content Specificity (1-10):**
- 9-10: Specific false factual claims with concrete details
- 7-8: Concrete statements that are debatable but specific
- 5-6: General statements with some specificity
- 1-4: Vague opinions or generalizations

**5. Context Appropriateness (1-10):**
- 9-10: Clear misinformation with no legitimate debate value
- 7-8: Mostly harmful with some legitimate concerns mixed in
- 5-6: Mixed aspects - some legitimate discussion points
- 1-4: Legitimate discussion or debate topic

### WEIGHTED SCORING FORMULA:
quality_score = (quote_strength × 0.3) + (factual_accuracy × 0.25) + (potential_impact × 0.25) + (content_specificity × 0.1) + (context_appropriateness × 0.1)

### FILTERING THRESHOLDS:
- Quote Strength: ≥ 6
- Factual Accuracy: ≥ 5
- Potential Impact: ≥ 5
- Content Specificity: ≥ 5
- Context Appropriateness: ≥ 5

### SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Final selection: Top 8-12 segments by quality score
- Minimum requirement: At least 6 segments must pass all thresholds
- If fewer than 6 segments qualify, reject entire analysis (do not lower standards)

This prompt is designed for evidence-based, conservative evaluation that prioritizes quality over quantity.
