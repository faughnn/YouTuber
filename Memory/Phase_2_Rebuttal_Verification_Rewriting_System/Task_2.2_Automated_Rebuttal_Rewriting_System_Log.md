**Agent:** APM Implementation Agent
**Task Reference:** Phase 2, Task 2.2: Automated Rebuttal Rewriting System

**Summary:**
Successfully extended the existing rebuttal verification system with automated improvement capabilities, externalized rewriting prompts for maintainability, and validated voice consistency preservation. The system now provides complete rebuttal rewriting functionality while maintaining the efficient batch API approach.

**Details:**
- Extended existing `rebuttal_verifier_rewriter.py` module (Task 2.1) rather than creating separate module to maintain architectural consistency
- Implemented individual rewriting functions: improve_rebuttal_accuracy() (fact correction), expand_rebuttal_completeness() (counter-arguments), strengthen_rebuttal_effectiveness() (persuasiveness), and enhance_source_reliability() (citation improvement)
- Externalized comprehensive rewriting prompt from embedded Python string to `Code/Content_Analysis/Quality_Control/rebuttal_rewriting_prompt.txt` for better maintainability
- Enhanced `_create_rebuttal_rewriting_prompt()` to load from external file with fallback error handling via `_load_rewriting_prompt_template()` and `_get_fallback_rewriting_prompt()`
- Maintained existing efficient batch processing approach: 3 rebuttals per assessment batch, 2 rebuttals per rewriting batch, preserving API efficiency
- Confirmed before/after comparison tracking already fully implemented via `improved_data` objects containing original_rebuttal, improved_rebuttal, improvement_reasoning, and timestamps
- Added rewriting_actions.json logging to Quality Control Results directory structure following established patterns
- Voice consistency validation confirmed: Jon Stewart style maintained through existing sophisticated prompt with entertainment value, sarcastic attribution, and factual grounding

**Output/Result:**
```
Enhanced Module: Code/Content_Analysis/rebuttal_verifier_rewriter.py
- Individual rewriting functions added as utilities (4 functions): 160 lines of specialized improvement logic
- External prompt loading system: _load_rewriting_prompt_template() with robust error handling
- Rewriting actions logging: Enhanced _save_quality_control_results() with rewriting_actions.json output

External Prompt File: Code/Content_Analysis/Quality_Control/rebuttal_rewriting_prompt.txt (4,221 characters)
- Complete Alternative Media Literacy voice specification with Jon Stewart energy
- TTS optimization guidelines with abbreviation rules and speech patterns  
- Improvement focus areas: accuracy (credible sources), completeness (missing arguments), effectiveness (persuasiveness)
- Example transformations showing voice consistency requirements

API Efficiency Maintained: Current implementation preserves optimal call patterns
- Assessment: ~4 API calls for 10 rebuttals (batch size 3)
- Rewriting: ~3 API calls for 6 rebuttals needing improvement (batch size 2)
- Total: ~7 API calls instead of potential 40+ calls with individual function approach

Test Results: Complete system validation successful
- External prompt loading: ✅ (4,221 character template loaded with required placeholders)
- Voice consistency: ✅ (Jon Stewart indicators preserved in output)
- Before/after tracking: ✅ (original_rebuttal and improved_rebuttal captured with metadata)
- Quality Control integration: ✅ (rewriting_actions.json saves improvement documentation)
```

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
No significant issues encountered. Initial approach of individual API calls per improvement type was reconsidered to preserve existing efficient batch processing architecture, which was the correct architectural decision.

**Next Steps:**
Automated Rebuttal Rewriting System fully implemented and ready for integration testing. External prompt file enables easy voice consistency adjustments without code changes. System seamlessly extends Task 2.1 verification framework with comprehensive improvement capabilities.
