**Agent:** APM Implementation Agent
**Task Reference:** Phase 2, Task 2.1: Rebuttal Verification Framework

**Summary:**
Successfully implemented comprehensive fact-checking system for generated rebuttals with 3-dimension assessment scoring and automatic rewriting triggers, including full schema validation and Quality Control Results integration.

**Details:**
- Created complete `rebuttal_verifier_rewriter.py` module following existing architectural patterns from quality_assessor.py and transcript_analyzer.py
- Implemented 3-dimension independent assessment system: assess_rebuttal_accuracy() (factual correctness 1-10), assess_rebuttal_completeness() (argument coverage 1-10), and assess_rebuttal_effectiveness() (persuasiveness 1-10)
- Designed verification triggers with exact specified thresholds: Accuracy < 7, Completeness < 6, Effectiveness < 6 trigger automatic rewriting
- Integrated with existing json_schema_validator.py using validate_script_input() and validate_verified_script_output() functions
- Implemented Gemini API integration following established patterns with batch processing, rate limiting, and comprehensive error handling
- Added comprehensive metadata tracking for assessment scores, rewriting decisions, and improvement areas as required by verified_unified_script_schema.json
- Created Quality Control Results directory structure following Task 1.2 patterns with detailed debug output and API call logging
- Generated rebuttal_verification_prompt.txt file containing evaluation criteria and improvement guidelines

**Output/Result:**
```
Core Module: Code/Content_Analysis/rebuttal_verifier_rewriter.py (1,053 lines)
- Main class: RebuttalVerifierRewriter with full verification pipeline
- Assessment functions: assess_rebuttal_accuracy(), assess_rebuttal_completeness(), assess_rebuttal_effectiveness()
- Verification logic: _identify_rebuttals_for_rewriting() with threshold enforcement
- Rewriting system: _rewrite_poor_rebuttals() with Gemini API integration
- Schema compliance: _create_verified_script() producing verified_unified_script_schema.json format

Verification Prompts: Code/Content_Analysis/Quality_Control/rebuttal_verification_prompt.txt
- 3-dimension evaluation criteria (1-10 scale)
- Verification triggers and improvement areas documentation
- Fact-checking methodology for rebuttal content assessment

Test Results: Comprehensive validation completed successfully
- Schema validation: ✅ (unified_podcast_script.json → verified_unified_script.json)
- Post-clip extraction: ✅ (found 10 rebuttal sections in test script)
- Assessment functions: ✅ (scoring 9/10 accuracy, 8/10 completeness, 3/10 effectiveness)
- Threshold logic: ✅ (correctly identified 1/3 rebuttals needing improvement)
- API integration: ✅ (successfully processed batches with rate limiting)

Quality Control Integration: Follows established patterns
- Results saved to Content/{podcast_name}/{episode_name}/Quality_Control_Results/rebuttal_verification/
- Debug files include all assessment results and API call documentation
- Comprehensive metadata tracking for verification decisions and improvements
```

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
Minor Unicode emoji compatibility issue resolved for Windows console output. All core functionality working correctly with comprehensive test validation.

**Next Steps:**
Module ready for integration with Task 2.2 (Automated Rebuttal Rewriting System) and downstream pipeline integration. All assessment functions, verification triggers, and Quality Control Results generation working as specified.
