**Agent:** Implementation Agent  
**Task Reference:** Phase 1, Task 1.1 - Core Flask Application Setup

**Summary:**
Successfully established the foundational Flask application structure with proper configuration, routing, template system, and Tailwind CSS integration for the YouTube Pipeline UI project.

**Details:**
Completed comprehensive setup of the Flask-based web interface foundation according to the Phase 1 specifications. Created complete directory structure within Code/UI/ including all required subdirectories for routes, templates, and static assets. Implemented modular Blueprint-based routing architecture with separate route modules for main dashboard (episodes management), pipeline control, segment selection, and preset management. Established Tailwind CSS integration using CDN approach for rapid development with responsive design principles. Configured proper Flask application factory pattern with SocketIO integration for future real-time updates. Set up comprehensive configuration management with Windows-compatible file paths and integration points for existing master_processor_v2.py. All route handlers include proper error handling and placeholder structures for future phase implementations.

Key architectural decisions made:
- Used Blueprint pattern for modular route organization supporting 6-phase development approach
- Implemented application factory pattern for proper Flask configuration management
- Integrated SocketIO foundation for real-time pipeline monitoring in future phases
- Designed responsive-first UI with Tailwind CSS using CDN for rapid iteration
- Established clear separation between Phase 1 foundation and future integration points
- Created comprehensive logging integration compatible with existing project logging patterns
