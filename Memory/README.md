# APM Project Memory Bank Directory

This directory houses the detailed log files for the Two-Pass AI Quality Control System project.

## Structure:

Logs are organized into subdirectories corresponding to each Phase in the `Implementation_Plan.md`. Within each phase directory, individual `.md` files capture logs for specific tasks.

### Phase Organization:
- `Phase_1_Core_Infrastructure_Schema_Foundation/` - JSON schemas, validation framework, and Pass 2 quality assessment
- `Phase_2_Rebuttal_Verification_Rewriting_System/` - Fact-checking and rebuttal improvement modules
- `Phase_3_Pipeline_Integration_Orchestration/` - Two-pass controller and downstream process updates
- `Phase_4_Quality_Control_Results_Test_Infrastructure/` - QC results framework and integration testing

### Task Log Files:
Each phase contains individual log files for tasks following the naming convention:
`Task_[Phase.Task]_Description_Log.md`

All log entries within these files adhere to the format defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`.
