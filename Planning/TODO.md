# YouTube Content Processing - TODO List

*Last Updated: June 3, 2025*

## üöÄ High Priority

### 1. YouTube Channel Branding
- [ ] **URGENT**: Come up with a name for the YouTube channel
  - [ ] Brainstorm channel names that reflect content critique/analysis focus
  - [ ] Consider names that convey media literacy, fact-checking, or critical thinking
  - [ ] Research availability of channel names and domain names
  - [ ] Finalize channel branding before video production

### 2. Video Clip Extraction from Analysis Results
- [ ] **URGENT**: Create video clip extraction functionality based on transcript analysis JSON output
  - [ ] Parse the JSON analysis results from transcript_analyzer.py
  - [ ] Extract timestamp ranges from `suggestedClip` and `fullerContextTimestamps` fields
  - [ ] Use existing video_segment_extractor.py as foundation
  - [ ] Auto-generate video clips for each flagged segment based on analysis themes:
    - [ ] Health and science misinformation segments
    - [ ] Conspiracy theory and anti-establishment narrative segments
    - [ ] Platforming of controversial figures segments
    - [ ] Any other themes identified by the analysis rules
  - [ ] Organize clips by narrative theme in subfolder structure
  - [ ] Include metadata files with clip context and analysis reasoning
  - [ ] Support batch processing of multiple analyzed episodes

### 3. Narrative Generation from Analysis
- [ ] **NEW**: Create narrative generation functionality for video scripts
  - [ ] Take the flagged segments from transcript analysis JSON output
  - [ ] Make a second Gemini API call to synthesize a coherent narrative
  - [ ] Generate video script structure connecting multiple clips thematically
  - [ ] Create introduction, transitions, and conclusion text for videos
  - [ ] Output formatted scripts with clip references and timing suggestions
  - [ ] Support different narrative styles (educational, critical analysis, documentary)

### 4. Workflow Automation
- [ ] Create a "master processing script" that:
  - [ ] Takes a YouTube URL or audio file as input
  - [ ] Downloads audio (if needed)
  - [ ] Generates transcript using audio_diarizer.py
  - [ ] Runs analysis using transcript_analyzer.py
  - [ ] Organizes everything into proper folders
  - [ ] Provides single-command workflow execution

## üìä Content Enhancement

### 5. Transcript Format Improvements
- [ ] Create script to convert JSON transcripts to other formats (VTT, plain text with timestamps)
- [ ] Add word-level timestamps for more precise editing

### 6. Content Analysis Expansion
- [ ] Create specialized analysis rules for different content types:
  - [ ] Interview-style content rules
  - [ ] Solo content/monologue rules
  - [ ] Educational content rules
- [ ] Add sentiment analysis capabilities
- [ ] Implement topic extraction algorithms
- [ ] Generate automated summaries or key quotes
- [ ] Create a database/index of all analyzed content for searching

## üé¨ Video Processing Integration

### 7. Video Clipper Enhancement
- [ ] Integrate transcript timestamps with video clipping
- [ ] Auto-generate clips based on transcript analysis:
  - [ ] Interesting quotes detection
  - [ ] Topic change detection
  - [ ] Highlight moments identification
- [ ] Create a web interface to browse transcripts and generate clips
- [ ] Implement batch video processing

## üîß Quality & Monitoring

### 8. System Reliability
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic to all scripts
- [ ] Create a dashboard to monitor processing status
- [ ] Add transcript quality scoring:
  - [ ] Confidence levels tracking

- [ ] Create formatted blog posts from analysis
- [ ] Export to various podcast/content platforms
- [ ] Generate social media snippets and quotes
- [ ] Create automated content calendars

### 12. Data Insights
- [ ] Track speaking patterns and topics over time
- [ ] Generate statistics on episode lengths and speaker ratios
- [ ] Create content performance analytics
- [ ] Implement trend analysis across episodes
- [ ] Build content recommendation engine

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Improvements
