struggles with Robert F. Kennedy Junior. The F is said twice. Perhaps remove the dot if its in a name

"Okay, let's do a quick fact check. One, Robert F. Kennedy Junior is a political candidate. He has zero authority to fire or hire anyone at a federal agency like the CDC or FDA. That is a complete fabrication." this is out of date. how can i make sure that the information is up to date?

"curdles into outright hate and fear-mongering against a vulnerable minority" the dash creates a pause. remove it

the whole script was too harsh. 

the video clips were too short in comparison to the audio clips
