**Audience:** Project Managers, Lead Developers, QA Managers  
**Last Updated:** June 5, 2025  
**Strategy:** MVP Testing Approach

## 📊 Executive Summary

The YouTube content processing pipeline currently has **39% overall test coverage**. After completing comprehensive Stage 1 testing, we're shifting to an **MVP testing strategy** for remaining stages to accelerate development while maintaining essential quality gates.

## 🎯 MVP Testing Strategy

After completing comprehensive Stage 1 testing, we're adopting an MVP approach for the remaining pipeline stages. This strategy focuses on:

- **Happy Path Coverage**: Essential functionality testing
- **Critical Error Handling**: Basic failure scenario coverage  
- **Integration Points**: Key module interaction testing
- **Smoke Tests**: Basic end-to-end validation

### MVP Coverage Targets
- **Overall Pipeline**: 60% (vs. previous 90% target)
- **Unit Tests**: 40% (critical functions only)
- **Integration Tests**: 70% (maintain current strength)
- **E2E Tests**: 80% (core workflows)

### Coverage by Test Type

| Test Category | Files | MVP Target | Status | Priority |
|---------------|-------|------------|---------|----------|
| **Unit Tests** | 3-5 | 40% | ❌ Minimal | 🟡 Medium |
| **Integration Tests** | 3 | 70% | ✅ Well Covered | 🟢 Low |
| **E2E Tests** | 3-4 | 80% | ⚠️ Basic Coverage | 🟡 Medium |
| **Smoke Tests** | 2-3 | 100% | ❌ Missing | 🔴 High |

## 🚨 MVP Testing Priorities

### Phase 1: Core MVP Tests (Next 1-2 weeks)
